# Nithin Bekal's dotfiles

This repo will contain the dot files I use to configure my system. The
[bin](bin) directory contains some utility scripts that get copied to `~/.bin`.

## Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nithinbekal/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

### Map Esc to Caps Lock (macOS)

Since macOS Sierra (10.12):

- System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier keys: Set Caps Lock to Escape.

### VS Code and Sublime

My config for VS Code and Sublime are in `editors/`, but these are not
automatically installed.

VS Code has problems with repeated keystrokes with the vim plugin on MacOS,
([details](https://wesleywiser.github.io/post/vscode-vim-repeat-osx/))
so this command needs to be run to fix that:

```bash
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```
